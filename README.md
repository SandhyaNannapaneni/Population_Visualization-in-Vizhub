### **Data Visualization using D3.js**  

This repository contains a collection of interactive data visualizations created using **D3.js**. It includes bar charts, scatter plots, and bubble charts to explore different datasets and extract meaningful insights. The data is managed through **GitHub Gist**, allowing for easy access and integration.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Bar Charts:** Visualizing population trends across different years and countries.  
- **Stacked Bar Charts:** Representing genre ratings using a structured, comparative approach.  
- **Scatter Plots:** Differentiating species in the Iris dataset based on key attributes.  
- **Bubble Charts:** Analyzing dataset attributes using size-based representation.  
- **D3.js Implementation:** Leveraging JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive visualizations.  
- **CSV & Gist Integration:** Datasets are stored in GitHub Gist for easy linking and retrieval.  

### **Project Overview:**  
The visualizations were designed to enhance data interpretation. They use **D3.js**, a powerful JavaScript library for handling data-driven graphics. Each visualization interactively presents data, making it easier to identify trends, compare categories, and analyze distributions.  

1. **Population Visualization:** A bar chart displaying the population of different countries in various years.  
2. **Genre Ratings Analysis:** A stacked bar chart that categorizes movie ratings based on genres.  
3. **Iris Dataset Exploration:** Scatter plots showcasing relationships between sepal length, petal width, and other features.  
4. **Bubble Chart Representation:** Using circle sizes to depict variations in dataset attributes.  

### **Technologies Used:**  
- **D3.js** – For creating interactive visualizations.  
- **JavaScript & HTML** – Front-end implementation.  
- **GitHub Gist** – Hosting datasets for accessibility.  
- **VizHub** – Editing and rendering visualizations.  

This repository demonstrates skills in **data visualization, JavaScript programming, and dataset management**, making it a valuable resource for learning and improving **data-driven storytelling**.
